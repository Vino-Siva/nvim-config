-- For most plugins its not enough to install them, you also need to call their `.setup()` to start them.
--
-- For example, lets say we want to install `guess-indent.nvim` - a plugin for
-- automatically detecting and setting the indentation.
--
-- We first install it from https://github.com/NMAC427/guess-indent.nvim
-- and then call its `setup()` function to start it with default settings.
vim.pack.add { 'https://github.com/NMAC427/guess-indent.nvim' }
require('guess-indent').setup {}
